Repository for basic python exercises
=============================================================

This git repository contains the exercises for the introduction to python developed for New Zealand Regional Councils.
The online course can be found `here <https://basic-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_.

We use Github Classroom
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this course we use Github Classroom to host the exercises.  Github Classroom allows students to copy repositories to
their own Github account. The new copy is separate from the original repository which allows the student to make changes
without affecting the original.  The author of the repository (the teacher) is also made a collaborator on the project so
they can check in on the student's work and provide feedback.  Our use of Github classroom is fairly simple, we just use
it's copying functionality and will not monitor or provide feedback.

Exercise Structure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This course has a number of exercises intended to help enviromental scienticts cut their teeth in programming.
Each exercise is provided both as a blank template and completed with the solutions.
Each exercise also has an automated checking routine, to help provide real time feedback to the user.  The way to use
these exercises is to complete the questions in the unsolved version of the exercise.  If you would like to check your
results, simply run the script.  The checking routine is fairly simplistic and is expected to be a guide only.

Exercise Prerequisites
